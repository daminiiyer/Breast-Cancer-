Breast Cancer Detection Project

Overview

This project focuses on analyzing breast cancer data to predict whether a cell is malignant or benign. Using machine learning techniques, specifically logistic regression, this analysis aims to assist in early detection and diagnosis of breast cancer based on various cellular features.

Methodology

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Comprehensive exploration of the dataset was conducted using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to uncover trends and insights.
Data Preprocessing: Data was cleaned and prepared for machine learning, ensuring high-quality input for model training.

Machine Learning: A logistic regression model was implemented using Scikit-learn to predict the malignancy or benignity of cells based on features such as radius, texture, concavity, and compactness.

Evaluation: The modelâ€™s performance was evaluated using standard metrics like accuracy and confusion matrices.
